D3 isn’t easy for people to pick up, because they often expect it to be a simple charting library. A case in point is the pie chart layout.D3 doesn’t have one single function to create a pie chart. Rather, it has a function that processes your dataset with the necessary angles so that, if you pass the dataset to D3’s arc function, you get the drawing code necessary to represent those angles. And you need to use yet another function to create the paths necessary for that code. It’s a much longer process than using dedicated charting libraries, but the D3 process is also its strength.     
You don’t invest your time learning D3 so that you can deploy Excel-style charts on the web. For that, there are easier, more convenient libraries. You learn D3 because it gives you the ability to implement almost every major data visualization technique.    
You modify the appearance of elements by using selections to reference the data bound to an element in a selection.    

haha: Congratulations! You’ve now successfully visualized the complex and ambiguous phenomenon known as “ugly.” :)

we can use g to group element.
