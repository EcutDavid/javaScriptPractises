### Notes
1.Webpack will give each module a special ID
2.Webpack need loader to parse the content of file(except vanlinna).
3.The dev server uses webpackâ€™s watch mode. It also prevents webpack from emitting the resulting files to disk. Instead it keeps and serves the resulting files from memory.
4.webpack --display-modules --display-chunks will display modules-chunk relationship
